              <p> I am a graduate student at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst.  My research focuses on the intersection of technology (networking, privacy, civic), economics (labor), development and public policy.</p>
              <p> Prior to graduate school, I worked as a staff member for the late Senator Edward M. Kennedy in his labory policy office on the U.S. Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions.</p>
              <p> After Senator Kennedy's passing, I joined the Administration of President Barack H. Obama as a presidentially appointed Congressional Liaison at the U.S. Department of Labor, where I had the honor to serve under Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis. Throughout my professional years in Washington, DC, I feel honored and grateful to have had the privilege to work on landmark pieces of legislation from pre-committee work to committee mark-up through final passage, including the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and the Matthew Shepard Hate Crimes Prevention Act of 2009. </p>
              <p> In my spare time, I enjoy humor, reading, traveling, futbol, outdoor activities, and learning foreign languages.</p>
